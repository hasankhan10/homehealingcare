Staying healthy at home is more important than ever. Here are our top five tips:

**1. Stay Active:** Incorporate at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise into your daily routine. This could be anything from a brisk walk, online yoga classes, or simple bodyweight exercises. Regular movement boosts your immune system and improves your mood.

**2. Eat a Balanced Diet:** Focus on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. A nutritious diet provides the essential vitamins and minerals your body needs to function optimally. Try to limit processed foods and sugary drinks.

**3. Prioritize Mental Health:** Set aside time for activities you enjoy, such as reading, hobbies, or talking with loved ones. Practice mindfulness or meditation to reduce stress and anxiety.

**4. Get Enough Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. A consistent sleep schedule helps regulate your mood, improve cognitive function, and support your immune system.

**5. Stay Connected:** Maintain social connections, even if it's virtually. Regular check-ins with friends and family can combat feelings of loneliness and isolation.

- Children with complex medical needs.

Consult with your doctor to determine if home healthcare is the right option for your specific situation.
